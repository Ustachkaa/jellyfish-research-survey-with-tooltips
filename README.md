# Jellyfish Research Survey with Tooltips

This project is a Jellyfish Research Application that combines a survey form for applicants with interactive tooltips to help guide users through the form fields. The primary goal of this project was to practice implementing tooltips in an interactive web form and to explore how to enhance user experience with helpful, context-specific guidance.

## Features

- **Tooltips for Form Fields**: Each form field is accompanied by a tooltip that provides helpful information when users hover over the field. These tooltips guide the user in filling out the form correctly.
- **Dynamic Video Background**: The webpage features a dynamic video background that switches between three videos in sequence, creating a visually engaging experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Character Count**: A real-time character count is displayed as users type in the "Statement of Interest" field, helping them stay within the 255-character limit.
- **Interactive Form**: Collects user information such as:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Age Range
  - Education Level
  - Research Experience
  - Statement of Interest
  - Preferred Research Method
  - Availability
